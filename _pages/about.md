I am Mohammad Imaran, PhD candidate under a joint doctoral program run by Monash University and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India. I have a master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Guwahati. My research deals with modelling of biological systems and stochastic processes. I also enjoy playing badminton, reading history/socio-political issues, and cooking.
